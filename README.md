### Hey there 👋

I am Giovanni Govert, a business graduate deeply interested in Tech and just started my journey to shift my career into Tech. I already had an AWS Solution Architect Associate and am proficient in using AWS Services such as S3 and IAM. 

💬My transition from the business world to the boundless realm of technology is more than a mere change of scenery; it's an opportunity to bridge the gap between these two vibrant domains. This GitHub  serves as a testament to my journey of transformation. So, let's embark on this thrilling expedition from business to Tech!🌱
